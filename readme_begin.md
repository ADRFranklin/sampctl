The Swiss Army Knife of SA:MP - vital tools for any server owner or library
maintainer.

## Overview

Server management and configuration tools:

* Manage your server settings in JSON format (compiles to server.cfg)
* Run the server from `sampctl` and let it worry about automatic restarts
* Automatically download Windows/Linux server binaries when you need them

Package management and dependency tools:

* Always have the libraries you need at the versions to specify
* No more copies of the Pawn compiler or includes, let `sampctl` handle it
* Easily write and run tests for libraries or quickly run arbitrary code
